1	Machine Translation Sample Code
This sample project is intended to allow you to make use of the Language Weaver API as fast as possible. It does not cover the full functionality of the API, but instead is focused on the two most common use cases:
•	Translate a string
•	Translate a file

The code is kept as tight as possible, with minimal error handling, and no UI. Edit LanguageWeaverTest.php with your account details before you start.

Tested with PHP 7.2.2
